# Spark Base Widget _(@ciscospark/spark-widget-base)_

> This base React component does the initial React, Spark authentication, and Redux setup for all Spark widgets.

## Usage

There are a number of ways to use our `spark-widget-base` repo to begin developing your own widget on the Cisco Spark platform.

### Quick Start

To automatically setup Cisco Spark connections, and register your widget into the global browser store, you can use the `sparkWidgetBase` enhancer like so:

``` js
import sparkWidgetBase from '@ciscospark/spark-widget-base';

function MyWidget(props) {
  return <div>My Widget</div>;
}

MyWidget.displayName = 'my-widget';

export default sparkWidgetBase(MyWidget);
```

> **NOTE**: Be sure to attach a `displayName` to your widget. This will be used to add your widget to the global namespace.

### Widgets using Redux

If you are also using `redux` for state management and want to provide your own reducers, import and use the `constructSparkEnhancer` higher order component instead:

``` js
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {constructSparkWidget} from '@ciscospark/spark-widget-base';

import reducers from './reducer';

class MyWidget extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div>My Widget's name is {this.props.displayName}</div>
  }
}

MyWidget.displayName = 'my-widget';

export default constructSparkEnhancer({
  reducers
})(MyWidget);
```

By constructing your component like this, the constructor will combine your reducers with internal spark reducers and update your store with a `react-redux` `<Provider />`. This will allow you to `connect()` any child components and gain access to the store.
